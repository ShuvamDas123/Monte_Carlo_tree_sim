# Monte_Carlo_tree_sim

This is a competition code from one of my courses csc384. Initially we were given to do a alpha beta minimax search for the game checkers
As checkers has on an average 36 moves and the game deoends on the depth of the tree
This is my own attempt to dominate the alpha beta approach with the monte carlo simulation
which can go upto a lot of the depth. Currently my implementation goes up to depth 50
